Here are the **steps** (without the Azure pipeline code) for **creating a release pipeline to deploy a .NET Core MVC application** to **Azure App Services** and **setting up a self-hosted agent**:

---

### **1. Create a Build Pipeline for .NET Core MVC Application**

1. **Create a New Pipeline** in Azure DevOps.
2. Select the **source repository** where your .NET Core MVC application is stored (Azure Repos, GitHub, etc.).
3. Define the **build steps**:
   - Use **DotNetCoreCLI** task to restore, build, and publish your application.
   - Publish build artifacts (e.g., as a `.zip` file) to a location where the release pipeline can pick them up.
4. **Run the build** to ensure that the application compiles and the artifacts are generated successfully.

### **2. Create a Release Pipeline**

1. **Navigate to the Pipelines > Releases** section in Azure DevOps.
2. **Create a New Release Pipeline**.
3. **Add the build artifact** generated from the build pipeline.
   - Link it to the build pipeline and select the artifact that was published (e.g., `drop`).
4. **Create a new stage** (e.g., `Production`, `Staging`) for the deployment.
   - Add the **Azure App Service Deploy** task to the stage.
   - Configure the task to deploy the artifacts to the appropriate **Azure App Service**.
5. **Configure environment variables** (if needed) such as app settings or connection strings specific to the environment.
6. **Save** and create a **release** to deploy the application to the Azure App Service.

### **3. Set Up and Use a Self-Hosted Agent**

1. **Navigate to the Agent Pools** section in Azure DevOps.
2. **Create a new self-hosted agent** if required.
3. **Download and configure the agent** on your desired machine (local or server).
   - Install the agent software on the machine by following the instructions in Azure DevOps.
   - Register the agent with the Azure DevOps **Agent Pool**.
4. **Verify the agent** is running and available in the **Agent Default Pool**.
   - Ensure the agent is properly listed in the **Agent Pools** section as **Online**.
5. **Configure the release pipeline** to use the self-hosted agent for deployment tasks (e.g., run deployment scripts, validate deployments).

### **4. Verify the Application Deployment**

1. **Monitor the deployment logs** in the Release Pipeline to ensure the deployment completes successfully.
2. **Check the Azure App Service** to verify the application is live and accessible.
3. **Use self-hosted agent logs** to verify that the agent has successfully downloaded and executed the deployment tasks.
4. **Perform post-deployment validation**, such as checking for application functionality or ensuring that all required resources (databases, APIs, etc.) are accessible.

By following these steps, you will create a build and release pipeline to deploy a .NET Core MVC application to Azure App Services and use a self-hosted agent for the deployment process.
