To complete this assignment without using Azure CLI, we will perform all tasks via the **Azure Portal**. This will involve several key steps, including:

1. **Creating a Virtual Machine (VM)** and installing Docker on it.
2. **Downloading the NGINX Docker image** on the VM.
3. **Creating an Azure Container Registry (ACR)**.
4. **Pushing the NGINX image to the ACR repository**.
5. **Creating an Azure Container Instance (ACI)** from the image stored in ACR.

Letâ€™s go through each of these steps one by one.

---

### **Step 1: Create a Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure**

1. **Go to the Azure Portal**:
   - Open [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. **Create a new Virtual Machine**:
   - In the left sidebar, click on **"Create a resource"**.
   - Search for **"Virtual Machine"** and select it.
   - Click **"Create"**.

3. **Configure VM settings**:
   - **Subscription**: Select your subscription.
   - **Resource Group**: Create a new resource group or use an existing one (e.g., `MyResourceGroup`).
   - **Virtual Machine Name**: Enter a name for the VM, e.g., `MyVM`.
   - **Region**: Select a region, e.g., **East US**.
   - **Image**: Choose **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** (or any Linux distribution that supports Docker).
   - **Size**: Select a size (e.g., `Standard B1s`).
   - **Authentication Type**: Use **SSH public key** for secure login. You can also use **Password** for simplicity, but SSH is recommended for production.
     - For SSH: Provide a public SSH key or generate one if you haven't already.
   - **Inbound Port Rules**: Allow SSH (port 22) for SSH access.

4. **Review and create the VM**:
   - Click **Next: Disks**. You can leave the default settings.
   - Click **Next: Networking** and configure the network (default settings are fine).
   - Click **Review + Create** and then click **Create** to provision the VM.

---

### **Step 2: Connect to the VM and Install Docker**

1. **Connect to the VM**:
   - Once the VM is created, go to the **Overview** page of the VM.
   - Click **Connect** and select **SSH** to get the SSH command.
   - Open your terminal (or use a tool like **Putty** if you use Windows) and connect using the provided SSH command.

   Example:
   ```bash
   ssh azureuser@<your-vm-ip>
   ```

2. **Install Docker on the VM**:
   Once connected to the VM, update the package list and install Docker with the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
   ```

3. **Start and enable Docker**:
   Run these commands to ensure Docker starts on boot:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   ```

4. **Verify Docker installation**:
   Check if Docker is installed correctly by running:

   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

### **Step 3: Download the NGINX Docker Image**

1. **Pull the NGINX Docker image**:
   Run the following command to pull the official NGINX image from Docker Hub:

   ```bash
   sudo docker pull nginx
   ```

2. **Verify the image is downloaded**:
   You can check the available Docker images by running:

   ```bash
   sudo docker images
   ```

---

### **Step 4: Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)**

1. **Create ACR in the Azure Portal**:
   - In the Azure Portal, go to **"Create a resource"**.
   - Search for **"Container Registry"** and select it.
   - Click **"Create"**.

2. **Configure the ACR**:
   - **Subscription**: Select your subscription.
   - **Resource Group**: Use the same resource group as the VM, or create a new one.
   - **Registry Name**: Enter a unique name for your ACR, e.g., `mynginxacr`.
   - **Location**: Select the region where your VM is deployed.
   - **SKU**: Choose **Basic** (for small-scale testing).
   - **Admin user**: Turn this on, which allows you to authenticate to the ACR using a username and password.

3. **Review and create**:
   - Click **Review + Create** and then **Create**.

---

### **Step 5: Push the NGINX Image to ACR**

1. **Login to the ACR**:
   - In the **Azure Portal**, navigate to your ACR and click on **Access keys** under **Settings**.
   - Copy the **Login Server** URL and **Username** and **Password** from here.
   
2. **Tag the NGINX image**:
   On the VM, tag the pulled NGINX image with your ACR login server URL:

   ```bash
   sudo docker tag nginx <acr-login-server>/<repository-name>:latest
   ```

   Replace `<acr-login-server>` with the Login Server URL from the ACR (e.g., `mynginxacr.azurecr.io`), and `<repository-name>` with the name of the repository (e.g., `nginx-repo`).

3. **Login to ACR using Docker**:
   Run the following command and enter the credentials (username and password) when prompted:

   ```bash
   sudo docker login <acr-login-server>
   ```

4. **Push the image to ACR**:
   Push the tagged image to the ACR:

   ```bash
   sudo docker push <acr-login-server>/<repository-name>:latest
   ```

### **Step 6: Create an Azure Container Instance (ACI) from the Image in ACR**

1. **Go to Azure Container Instances**:
   - In the Azure Portal, search for **"Container Instances"** and select it.
   - Click on **"Create"** to create a new container instance.

2. **Configure ACI settings**:
   - **Subscription**: Choose your subscription.
   - **Resource Group**: Use the same resource group.
   - **Container Name**: Give a name to the container (e.g., `nginx-container`).
   - **Region**: Choose the same region as the VM and ACR.
   - **Image**: Under **Image Source**, select **Azure Container Registry** and then choose your ACR and the `nginx-repo` image you pushed earlier.
   - **Ports**: Expose port 80, as NGINX typically runs on this port.

3. **Review and Create**:
   - Click **Review + Create** and then **Create** to provision the container.

---

### **Step 7: Verify the Container Instance**

1. **Access the NGINX container**:
   Once the container is created, go to the **Overview** of the ACI, and you will see the **IP address** for your container instance.

2. **Test the NGINX website**:
   Open a web browser and navigate to the IP address of the ACI. You should see the default NGINX welcome page, confirming that your container is running successfully.

### **Summary of Tasks**:

1. **Created a Virtual Machine (VM)** in Azure and installed Docker on it.
2. **Downloaded the NGINX Docker image** on the VM.
3. **Created an Azure Container Registry (ACR)** and pushed the NGINX Docker image to the ACR.
4. **Created an Azure Container Instance (ACI)** from the image stored in ACR and accessed the running NGINX container.
